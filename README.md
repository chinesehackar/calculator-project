# calculator-project

Created a calculator which is the last project of the Odin Project Foundations. The UI of this calculator was inspired by Apple.

Here are some of the features you can play around with:

- basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- keyboard support
- decimal calculations
- clear all and delete

See if you can break my calculator. I'd be more than happy to identify overlooked mistakes.
